<b>Welcome to Prophet Lovy Ministries!</b>
 
<br>
<br>
As part of our mission to build a people of fire, this website collects and processes some information. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your personal information. By using any of Prophet Lovy Ministries' sites you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
 
<br>
<br>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our privacy practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will give you notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on this Website, and where appropriate, by other means. By continuing to use this Website or the Support Service after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.
 
<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or perform a transaction from prophetlovy.com or other web properties developed and managed by Prophet Lovy Ministires (the “Site”).

<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>What information do we collect about you?</b>
<br>
<br>
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” 
 
<br>
<br>
We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
 
 	<ul>
	    <li>– “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" class="mail_link">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    – “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    – “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
	    </li>
 	</ul>
<br>
<br>
We also collect personal information submitted by you via any messaging feature (including email sign up forms) available from any of our websites (“Messaging Feature”).
 
<br>
<br>
Additionally when you make a purchase/donation or attempt to make a purchase/donation through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number.  We refer to this information as “Transaction Information.”
<br>
<br>
 
When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Transaction Information.
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
<b>How do we use your personal information?</b>

<br>
<br>
We use the Transaction Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).  Additionally, we use this Transaction Information to:
<br>
<br>
Communicate with you;
<br>
Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
<br>
When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
 
<br>
<br>
We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
<br>
<br>
If you’ve previously opted in to email marketing from us, and you decide to longer be included in those communications, you can opt out via the “unsubscribe” link offered in all of our marketing emails. If you have opted in to multiple email marketing lists with us, you will need to opt out of each list.
 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>What we don’t do with your personal information</b>
<br>
<br>
We do not and will never share, disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide personal information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services.
<br>
<br>
 
<b>How do we keep your personal information secure?</b>
<br>
<br>
We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard sensitive information, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee details and any other personal information entrusted to us. Our information security systems apply to people, processes and information technology systems on a risk management basis.
 
<br>
<br>
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.
 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Sharing your personal information</b>
<br>
<br>
We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.  For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site–you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" onclick="pager('https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/')" class="mail_link">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.  You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" onclick="pager('https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout')" class="mail_link">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
 
<br>
<br>
Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
 
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
<b>Do Not Track</b>
<br>
<br>
Please note that because there is no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to “Do Not Track” signals, we do not alter our data collection and usage practices when we detect such a signal from your browser.
 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Your Rights</b>
<br>
<br>
If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.
 
<br>
<br>
Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.  Additionally, please note that your information may be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States depending on the location of our data servers.
 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Data Retention</b>
<br>
<br>
In general, we keep your personal information throughout your relationship with us. When you place an order or donation through the Site, we will maintain your Transaction Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.
 
<br>
<br>
Once you terminate your relationship with us, we generally will continue to store archived copies of your personal information for legitimate business purposes and to comply with the law, except when we receive a valid erasure request.
 
<br>
<br>
We will continue to store anonymous or anonymized information, such as website visits, without identifiers, in order to improve our Services.
 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Changes</b>
<br>
<br>
We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
 
<br>
